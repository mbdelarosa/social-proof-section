## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

Did this challenge to practice my usage of grid and flexbox, working mobile-first to make sure the solution is responsive across different screen sizes. Other learnings from this challenge:
	- Use of two background images with own positioning and properties
	- Profile photos should have an alt text with the customer's name
	- Alignment of flex items

### Continued development

Would like to continue practicing usage of grid and flexbox, as well as the use of `clamp` to make font sizes also responsive
